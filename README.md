Nexys 3 Starter Files
===============

* **counter.v**  - Simple counter circuit, outputs high one each cycle
* **debounce.v** - Debounce circuit for noisy inputs (buttons)
* **seven_segment_display.v** - Driver to use the 7-seg to display 4 hexadecimal numbers
* **nexys3_top.v** - Top-level file that instantiates all inputs/outputs on the board

# Top-level File

The top-level file is still a work-in-progress and does not instantiate all of the inputs or outputs yet. I will be expanding it as I interface with more and more of the board. Feel free to add in the missing I/O and assignments.
